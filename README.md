## üåê Deployment

### Streamlit Cloud Deployment

1. **Push to GitHub**
   - Ensure all files including `requirements.txt` are in your repository
   - Your `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file should NOT be pushed to GitHub for security

2. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud**
   - Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set the main file as `app.py`

3. **Configure Secrets in Streamlit Cloud**
   - In Streamlit Cloud, go to your app settings
   - Add your secrets in the "Secrets" section:
   ```toml
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   
   [firebase]
   type = "service_account"
   project_id = "your-project-id"
   private_key_id = "your-private-key-id"
   private_key = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nyour-private-key\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
   client_email = "your-service-account-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
   client_id = "your-client-id"
   auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
   token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
   auth_provider_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
   client_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-service-account-email%40your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
   ```

### Local Development
- Use `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file for local development
- Never commit your secrets file to version control
- Keep your Firebase service account key secure

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Firebase configuration not found in secrets"**
   ```bash
   # Ensure your .streamlit/secrets.toml file exists and contains firebase configuration
   ```

2. **"Please set GEMINI_API_KEY in Streamlit secrets"**
   - Ensure your `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file exists and contains the API key
   - Check that the API key is valid and active

3. **"Firebase initialization failed"**
   - Verify your Firebase service account credentials are correct
   - Ensure Firestore database is enabled in your Firebase project
   - Check that the private key format is correct (with proper line breaks)

4. **"JSON parsing error"**
   - The AI response might be malformed
   - Try rephrasing or simplifying the job posting text
   - Check if the input text contains clear job-related information

5. **Authentication Issues**
   - Check if the password in app.py matches what you're entering
   - Clear browser cache and try again

6. **Date Parsing Issues**
   - The app supports multiple formats: DD/MM/YYYY, DD.MM.YY, natural language
   - If dates aren't parsing correctly, try reformatting the input text

7. **API Rate Limits**
   - Gemini API has usage limits
   - Wait a few minutes before trying again
   - Consider upgrading your API plan for higher limits
